# RegUBot 
This was created to automate the boring task of filling up timesheets on a monthly basis and pass compliance tests at my previous organisation. 
If your organisation uses RegU, this might just be useful for you.

# Features
- Passes RegU tests using Selenium based web automation. 
- Stores answers of the tests in a txt file which can be easily shared.
- Supports Chrome, IE, Firefox.
- Uses C# console app and can be easily ported to .Net Core
